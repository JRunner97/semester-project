Sprint 3: Update and Improve Issues in GitHub 

I gave you specific feedback in the requirements refinery assignment. But, in general, most groups need more detail and clarity. 

[Here's a list of repositories and issue repositories, where different, for your reference. Looking around at other team repositories is part of how you can learn things. Feel free to ask for clarifications on the issues you see in their repositories. In OTHER WORDS, comment on other team's issues.](https://github.com/computationalmystic/semester-project/blob/master/team-repositories.md) 

NOTE: I am making this due Monday because you really need this completed in many cases before starting sprint 3 out properly. With that in mind, I absolutely need these finished by Thursday before class (10 am) this week to know your groups are making progress. It's possible to continue development for sprint 3 in parallel with this task, but its possibly going to come back and bite you in one way or another.Remember: Requirements defects are the most expensive to fix.  

Your issues in GitHub need to be refined, mostly through the addition of more specificity and clarity, in GitHub. Please look at your group's feedback on the requirement's refinery assignment to make sure you address any points specific for your group. 

With regards to refining issues, I will put that as part of a "sub assignment for sprint 3" shortly. Your goal is to describe it enough detail that anyone could read it, look at your project, and understand what needs to be done: 

Here are a few tips:
1. If you are referring to improvements in the user experience, paste an image of the screen you want to improve with some notes. You can drag and drop images into a GitHub issue. 
2. If something is broken or not working, show some detail on what readme.md you are following from another project and where you are encountering specific issues. 
3. Assign people to the issues. More than one person can be assigned.Here's an issue template we use on Augur that can be helpful. Some sections may not apply, but almost every group needs more description. Some are pretty good. Others have simple the title with no description at all. Follow these guidelines. You do NOT need to cover every section for its own sake. Exclude it if you need to. In many cases, the simple addition of ANY description at all is needed.
