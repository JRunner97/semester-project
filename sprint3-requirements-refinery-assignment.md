# Sprint 3 Requirements Refinery 

## The Assignment: Part 1

As noted today in class, by Thursday I want your teams to write a paragraph or two describing how a particular person (or "type of person", sometimes called a "persona" in the interaction design world) will interact with your system. 

The "persona" depth of description does not need to be this detailed, but describe the full cycle of activity your user will operate the system to accomplish.

## More Information and Context on Part 1

This may mean you walk through your system, discover places where doing that is difficult, and then open Issues in your GitHub repository. Note: If you are using a repo that is a fork of another repo, you will not have "issues" as an option, so just use the ComputationalMystic Repo you have in those cases.

Example 1: https://blackshellmedia.com/2017/01/30/use-personas-game-development/

Example 2: https://medium.com/@fernandocomet/the-player-persona-template-d171e3e0c05d

Obviously those examples are intended to give you an idea of how elaborate persona development can become. The more complex the system, the more important they become because they guide thousands of small and important decisions over the course of months and years.Open Issues for ALL of the work that you think remains to be done to accomplish the scenario you present in a paragraph or two. Ideally, this is approximately what your use cases have already guided you towards. I am aware that in some cases groups are ahead or behind. 

## The Assignment: Part 2

You will not be able to say, "yup, we're done for sprint 3 or 4." So open enough issues that you are in a position to pick and choose which ones you work towards. This exercise is not about anything more than beginning the shaping of the third sprint with your group's reflection on: 
1. What you are doing
2. How much fun you are having doing it
3. And finding explicit ways, as a project matures, to experience the "punctuated equilibrium" that is fundamental to all group work. The attached article may be useful for you to reflect on after the semester.
